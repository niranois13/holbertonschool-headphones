## Project Overview

This project is a _from-scratch implementation_ of a fully functional web page using __HTML__ and __CSS__, incorporating _accessibility_ and _responsive design_ principles. The aim is to replicate the provided design file as closely as possible, showcasing a deep understanding of __web development fundamentals__.

<br /><br />

## Features

The outcome should be a pixel-perfect _design replication_ based on the provided ![__designer file__](#https://www.figma.com/design/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=ExLZorhTrkHbZzB7-0). <br />
It will incorporate __Responsive layout__ that adapts seamlessly to _different screen sizes_ and devices. It should also include __Accessible components__ to ensure _inclusivity for users with disabilities_. __Semantic HTML__ structure will be used for a _better SEO referencement and readability_.

<br /><br />

## Technologies Used

__HTML5__: For semantic markup.

__CSS3__: For styling and layout, including advanced features like Flexbox.

__Media Queries__: For responsive design.

No _libraries_ or _frameworks_ were used to maintain the purity of implementation.

<br /><br />

## Accessibility Considerations

This project adheres to the following __accessibility__ principles:

1. Use of _semantic HTML elements_ (e.g., <header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>).
2. Proper labeling for form elements using <label> and aria-* attributes where applicable.
3. Keyboard navigation support, ensuring all interactive elements can be accessed without a mouse.
4. Sufficient color contrast for text and background elements.
5. Descriptive alt text for all images.

<br /><br />

## Responsive Design

The web page layout is designed to adapt to various screen sizes through the use of  media queries, relative units (rem/%) and Flexbox for dynamic content alignment.

<br /><br />

## Acknowledgements

This project is a culmination of the __knowledge__ and __skills__ gained through previous _learning modules_ on __web development__.
